We are working on the management of the chaos caused by floods in various flood prone regions and how it can be avoided.
Floods cause more damage than we think. taking numerous lifes and causing damage to crops and various agricutural related industry which heavily contribute to india's GDP.
To avoid all these chaos the best way is to predict the flood outbreaks with the most precision!
We are planning to create a emergency app which will not only give warning to people living in flood prone area beforehand, so they have an advantage and thus could save their life and property in these situations but will also suggest them how to survive if they are caught in flood ( example farmers could benefit from the ideas provided by the app to help save their crops or atleast their lives). 
We can trace past floods and trace their time and place. Then, we can specify regions from safe to high danger regions according to floods frequency .
We will collect data from different sources such as weather forecasting companies and satellite images to trace the future path of flood.
Using the data analysis, we didive a particular region on the scale of 'safe' to 'highly prone' and will provide the user's location where they lie.
